                        <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
                        <p>There is a direct relationship between percentage of people suffering from lack of healthcare and percentage of people in poverty amongst the states in the USA. States with higher levels of poverty tend to have more people without
                            healthcare. Moreover, states with more people in Poverty also tend to smoke more and have a higher obesity rate. </p>

                        <p>With regards to median age, there was little visible correlation with the obesity rate (almost every state had a high obesity rate). Secondly, median age was inversely proportional to lack of healthcare in each state—the higher
                            the median age, the lower the percentage of people without healthcare— and there direct correlation median age and percentage of people that smoke.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, there were clear inverse correlations between median household income and percentage of smokers, obesity rate and lack of healthcare amongst the different states. States with higher median incomes usually tend to have lower
                            percentages of obesity, they smoked less and they had more access to healthcare.</p>
